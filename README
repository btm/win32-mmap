= Description
   This package provides a Ruby interface for memory mapped I/O on MS Windows.
   
= Prerequisites
   Ruby 1.8.2 or later.
   windows-pr, 0.5.5 or later.

= Installation
   gem install win32-mmap
   
= Synopsis
   require 'win32/mmap'
   include Win32
   
   map1 = MMap.new(:file => "C:\\test.map", :size => 1024)
   map1.foo = 'hello'
   map1.bar = 77
   map1.close
   
   map2 = MMap.new(:file => "C:\\test.map")
   p map2.foo # 'hello'
   p map2.bar # 77
   map2.close

= About Memory Mapped Files under Windows
   Under Windows, code and data are both repesented by pages of memory backed
   by files on disk, code by executable image and data by system pagefile
   (i.e. swapfile). These are called memory mapped files. Memory mapped files
   can be used to provide a mechanism for shared memory between processes.
   Different processes are able to share data backed by the same swapfile,
   whether it's the system pagefile or a user-defined swapfile.

   Windows has a tight security system that prevents processes from directly
   sharing information among each other, but mapped memory files provide a
   mechanism that works with the Windows security system by using a name that
   all processes use to open the swapfile.

   A shared section of the swapfile is translated into pages of memory that are
   addressable by more than one process, Windows uses a system resource called a
   prototype page table entry (PPTE) to enable more than one process to address
   the same physical page of memory, thus multiple process can share the same
   data without violating the Windows system security.

   In short, memory mapped files provide shared memory under Windows.

	module.)
